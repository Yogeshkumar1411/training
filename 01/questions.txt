1. Toggle and clear bit in given number 

2. Storage classes 

3. Compilation process (in detail) 

4. Recusrion function ( What happens if the base condition is not defined in recursion) 

5. Const and volatile difference(volatile in detial) 

6. Have you used any debugging tools(if yes, then how can we check the local varible in watch window) 

7. What happen if we define static variable in header file and add in 2 different c file. 

8. How can we read or write a value to fixed memory location(write a program) 

9. Microprocessor and microcontroller difference 

10. SPI protocol in detail 

11. Have you worked on any testing process 

12. ADC( vref =5v, adc 10bit, analog volt = 3v, digital value ?), Timer 

13. Difference between 16 and 32 bit processor 

14. Suppose we have to configure ADC, what are the steps(Reference datasheet)
