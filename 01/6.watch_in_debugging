Have you used any debugging tools (if yes, then how can we check the local varible in watch window):

	->Yes, I have used Visual Studio  2019 inbuild debugger. In that easily we can add watch window using GUI.
	->If want to add watch window, the code should be in debug mode.
	->And, we should have required breakpoints.
	->the watch is very useful to evaluate the variables or the expressions.
	
	
	->After that I have used GDB debugging tool. We can add by using command watch <variable_name>
	->Same as like Visual Studio, the code should be in debug mode and it should have required breakpoints.
