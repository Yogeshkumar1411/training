1.Explain what p holds int (**p)[10];//it is pointer to an array pointer 
2.Explain what p hold int (*p)[10];//this will holds the address of fist element in the array 
3.what is the size of union  
union test{ 
int a; 
int b; 
char c; 
float f; 
}; 
4 what is the size of structure 
union test{ 
int a; 
int b; 
char c; 
float f; 
}; 

union test t1,t2; 
struct test_struct{ 
union t3; 
union t4; 
}; 

5 what is the value of var? 

union test{ 
int a; 
int b; 
int c; 
float f; 
}; 

t1.c=2; 
t1.a=3; 
t1.b=5; 
t1.b= t1.a * t1.b * (t1.c++) 
var = t1.c; 

6.what is the value of var? 

union test{ 
int a; 
int b; 
int c; 
float f; 
}; 

t1.c=2; 
t1.a=3; 
t1.b=5; 
t1.b= t1.a * t1.b * (t1.c) 
var = t1.c; 

7.explain about UART 
8.what is baud rate 
9.what are mode in the UART 
10.what is simplex,half duplex,full duplex 
11.what id the value of f? 
union test{ 
int a; 
int b; 
char c; 
float f;
