what is the size of structure 
union test{ 
int a; 
int b; 
char c; 
float f; 
}; 

//union test t1,t2; 
struct test_struct{ 
union test t1; 
union test t2;
}; 


->for ex: int 4 bytes
		  char 1 byte
		  float 4 bytes
		  
		  size of t1 = 4 bytes
		  size of t2 = 4 bytes
		  
		  size of the structure is 8 bytes
