1. Difference between macros and functions. 
2. C programs to demonstrate macros and functions.(Advantages of using both) 
3. C Compilation stages. 
4. How does compiler work(what is meant by 16/32 bit compiler) 
5. Can we flash a code compiled in 16 bit compiler on a 32 bit target board. 
6. How to store 32 bit data into a 16 bit MCU ( write a program for it). 
7. Write a c program to toggle 7th bit of a number. 
8. what is Stack. How does data gets stored in it. Are there any exceptions. 
9. What are interrupts. How many interrupts are there in STM32 MCU. 
10. What happens if multiple or all interrupts are triggered at the same time. 
11. How many Linker registers are there?
